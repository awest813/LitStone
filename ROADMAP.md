# LitStone Roadmap

The goal is a fully-featured Hearthstone-style card game where every card, hero, and story moment comes from **public domain literature** — mythology, Gothic fiction, Victorian novels, epic poetry, and folk tales.

## Card Mechanics Backlog

These mechanics are designed but not yet implemented in the engine:

- **Silence** — Remove all keywords and effects from a minion (`nevermore` spell)
- **Lifesteal** — Damage dealt heals your hero (Dracula-class mechanic)
- **Transform** — Replace a minion with a new one (Lycanthropy, Lucy → vampire)
- **Discover** — Choose 1 of 3 random cards to add to your hand
- **Overload** — Pay extra on a future turn (powerful spells with a cost)
- **Inspire** — Triggers whenever your hero power is used
- **Token summoning** — Cards that create extra minions (Trojan Horse → Soldiers)
- **Enrage** — Minion gains bonus while damaged (works well for The Creature)
- **Resurrect** — Return last dead minion to board

## Design Principles

1. **Public domain only** — every character and story reference must be out of copyright
2. **Thematic coherence** — each deck tells a story; cards within a deck synergise around their source material
3. **No external assets** — all art is CSS/SVG; the game must run from a single `python server.py`
4. **Faithful to the literature** — card mechanics should reflect the character's narrative role (Achilles is fast but fragile; The Creature is powerful but lonely/taunt; Dracula drains life)
